# Smartwatch_DA_python
Hello everyone...
here i have done Smartwatch Data Analysis using Python
The dataset I am using for Smartwatch data analysis is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset was initially collected from 30 female users of the Fitbit smartwatch.

# Observations:
81.3% of Total inactive minutes in a day
15.8% of Lightly active minutes in a day
On an average, only 21 minutes (1.74%) were very active
and 1.11% (13 minutes) of fairly active minutes in a day

Tuesday is, therefore, one of the most active days for all individuals in the dataset, as the highest number of calories were burned on Tuesdays.
So this is how you can analyze smartwatch data using the Python programming language. There is a lot more you can do with this dataset. You can also use it for predicting the number of calories burned in a day.
Summary
So this is how you can analyze the data collected by a smartwatch about fitness using Python. Smartwatches are preferred by people who like to take care of their fitness. Analyzing the data collected on your fitness is one of the use cases of Data Science in healthcare. I hope you liked this article on Smartwatch data analysis using Python.
